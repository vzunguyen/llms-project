# Project Brief
This project is based on the workshop [Building LLMs from the Ground Up: A 3-hour Coding Workshop](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/building-llms-from-the-ground-up). It is my first exploration into building a language model from scratch.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the inner workings of large language models (LLMs) by implementing one from the ground up.
